# Crop Price Prediction

## Overview

This project aims to predict crop prices using machine learning techniques. While the initial description is minimal, this README provides a comprehensive guide to understanding, setting up, and potentially contributing to this project. The ultimate goal is to provide farmers and other stakeholders with valuable insights for better decision-making.

## Key Features & Benefits

*   **Price Prediction:** Predicts future crop prices based on historical data and relevant factors.
*   **Data Analysis:** Provides tools for analyzing historical crop price trends.
*   **User-Friendly Interface (Future):** Aims to offer an intuitive interface for interacting with the prediction models.
*   **Open-Source:** Encourages community contributions and improvements.

## Prerequisites & Dependencies

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

*   **Python:** Version 3.7 or higher is recommended.
*   **Pip:** Python package installer.
*   **Virtualenv (Optional but recommended):** For creating isolated Python environments.

**Required Python Packages:** (These will be specified in a `requirements.txt` file later as the project develops.)

*   `pandas`
*   `numpy`
*   `scikit-learn`
*   `matplotlib`
*   `seaborn`

To install these packages (once `requirements.txt` is created):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Installation & Setup Instructions

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/rajat-karad/crop-price-prediction.git
    cd crop-price-prediction
    ```

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:** (Once `requirements.txt` is populated)

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Project Setup:**

    *   **Data:** Download or generate necessary datasets for training and testing the models.  Place these datasets into a dedicated `data` directory.  (Example: `data/crop_data.csv`, `data/weather_data.csv`)
    *   **Models:** Trained models will be saved in a `models` directory.

## Usage Examples

**Example: Running a basic prediction script** (Assuming a script named `predict.py` is created later):

```bash
python predict.py --crop_type wheat --location california
```

**Expected output (example):**

```
Predicted price for wheat in California: $250/ton
```

**Note:** The specific usage will depend on the implemented scripts and their command-line arguments.

## Configuration Options

While no specific configuration is provided in this initial README, future configurations may include:

*   **Environment Variables:** For API keys, database credentials, etc.
*   **Configuration Files:**  Using `.ini`, `.yaml`, or `.json` files for model parameters and other settings.
