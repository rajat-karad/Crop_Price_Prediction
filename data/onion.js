This aromatic vegetable is a member of the Allium family, which also includes garlic, leeks, and chives, adds its distinct pungent flavour and aroma to countless Indian dishes. The cultivation of onions is a vital pillar in India’s agricultural sector as, makes major contributions to the agricultural economy.</br> </br>Leading onion-producing states like Maharashtra, Karnataka, Gujarat, and Madhya Pradesh play a key role in this industry. The demand for onions in India is high, and the crop is an important source of income for many farmers in the country.  Yet, there is untapped potential for boosting productivity by fine-tuning growth factors. In this blog, we will look into the fundamental aspects of onion cultivation, from nurturing early seedlings to the successful harvest.</br>",

It prefers moderate temperature in summer as well as in winte</br>The onion crop is a cool season crop.</br></br><b>Temperature Range:</b> Onions thrive in temperatures ranging from 13°C to 32°C, making them suitable for the diverse climates across India</br></br><b>Rainfall :</b> Adequate rainfall during the growing season is crucial for a successful onion crop. The right amount of moisture contributes to the development of healthy bulbs. There should be an irrigation facility as the crop requires proper water availability in the soil at the bulb growth stag</br></br>",
   "soil":"Almost all soil types are suitable for onion cultivation. However, sandy loam to clay soil with good drainage, moisture holding capacity and rich in organic matter is considered ideal. </br>Optimum soil pH for its growth is 6 – 7.5. Onion is sensitive to highly acidic, saline and alkali soils. Avoid waterlogging in the field.</br>",

   "yield":"Depending on the variety and season, onions produce varying yields. </br>In the rabi season, irrigated onion crops yield 10-12 tons per acre, while rainfed crops yield only 300 to 400 kg per acre.</br>Sugarcane and turmeric intercropped with onion in alleys of young fruit gardens and banana gardens yield 2-3.5 tons per acre. </br>The small, pungent, local cluster onions yield half as much compared to the large varieties.</br>",
   "landPreparation":"There are two major methods of onion cultivation first one is directly sowing onion seed in the main field, and the second one is growing onion in the early stage in the nursery and then transplanting seedlings after 50 to 60 days.</br></br>Approximately 200 square meters of nursery bed area can transplant seedlings in one acre. Ploughing the field five to six times to break clods and well-pulverize it to prevent it from drying out is recommended. Before preparing the bed, removing debris, weeds and stones from the previous crops is important. Mix half a ton of well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) with the soil after the last ploughing.</br></br>It may be convenient to prepare a raised bed with a height of 10-15 cm, a width of 1.0-1.2 m, and a length of 1.0 -1.2 m to raise the nursery. A distance of at least 30 cm should be maintained between beds to ensure uniform water movement and drainage of excess water. Raised beds are recommended for nurseries because flatbeds allow water to move from one end to another, washing seeds away. Water drainage is another major problem with flatbed seedling raising.</br></br>For one acre of seedlings, two to three kilograms of seeds are required. Sowing seeds 50 to 75 mm apart is recommended so they can be transplanted easily, weeded quickly, sprayed with pesticides, etc. A thin layer of fine powdered farmyard manure or compost should be applied to the seeds after they have been sown, followed by light watering.</br></br>",
   "irrigation":"Onion Crops require time-to-time irrigations in order to get maximum yield. In general, Onion needs irrigation at the time of transplanting ,   3 to 5 days after transplanting and then after 7 to 10 days intervals. It depends on the soil type, if the soil is light then frequent irrigations are necessary. </br></br>At the time of irrigation take care that excess water should get drained, as onion is very sensitive to water lodging conditions. It invites infection of different fungal diseases, like wilt, root rot etc. If possible, apply modern irrigation techniques such as drip or sprinkler, which not only save water quantity and ease for application of liquid fertilizer for plants but also improve yield significantly.</br></br>",

   "interCropping": "Onion can be grown as an intercrop with sugarcane during the initial 5 months after planting sugarcane. </br></br>They can be rotated with legumes, corn, brassica and solanaceous crops. Onions are heavy feeders and can quickly deplete the soil of nutrients. Rotating onions with legume crops can help to replenish the soil with nitrogen. </br></br>",
   "harvesting":"For dry onion, the crop is ready for harvesting in five months.For green onion, the crop becomes ready in three months.</br></br>There are some typical signs of onion maturity like onion illegal events eventually collapsing at a point a little above the top of the bulb known as neck fall if 50% of the crop shows at this size it means our crop is ready for harvest. There is also a change in the colour of the bulb as the bulb gets mature its colour changes to red or white as per the variety. This parameter can be judged by uprooting some onions and then carefully observing for maturity signs. When you confirm maturity start harvesting onions, after harvesting don’t cut onion tops from the bulb immediately, because nutrients and cell sap available in the leaf get slowly translocated towards the bulb, which improves bulb quality as well as weight. Keep harvested produce under shade and after 5 days start cuttings of leave.</br>Storage: Final produce should be stored in a dry and cool place.",

Application of urea, SSP and MOP at rates 400:1500:250 kg/ha is recommended for grapes farm.",
    "interCropping": "Inter-cropping with grapes can be a beneficial practice, as it optimizes land use, increases biodiversity, and may even improve grape quality.<br/>i.	Cover crops: Legumes such as clover or vetch can be grown between grapevine rows. These plants fix nitrogen in the soil, reducing the need for synthetic fertilizers and enhancing soil health.<br/>ii.	Herbs and Medicinal Plants: Herbs like rosemary, thyme, or lavender can be grown between grapevines. These plants not only add aesthetic value but can also attract beneficial insects and repel pests.<br/>iii.	Nuts: Depending on the spacing and arrangement of the vineyard, certain nut trees like almonds or hazelnuts may be suitable inter-crops.",
    "harvesting": "It is essential to harvest grapes only when they are fully ripe. Since grapes do not ripen simultaneously, multiple pickings are required to harvest the entire crop. The taste of the berries serves as the primary indicator of maturity. If the berries at the tip of a bunch are flavourful, it indicates that the entire cluster is ready for harvestingd.</br> Harvesting typically begins 30-70 days after the fruit set, when the berries transition from green to yellow (for white varieties) or red-purple (for red varieties). It is important to pluck the bunches close to the cane, allowing for a sufficiently long stem that facilitates handling during picking, packing, displaying and selling. The natural bloom on the berries should not be wiped off during handling. Harvesting is best done during the cooler hours of the day and after harvesting, it is crucial to protect the bunches from direct sunlight exposure.d.</br>Normal grape harvest season starts in February and continuous up to end of April. Well matured bunches having at least 180 Brix are harvested.</br>Harvested grapes are packed in 2 to 4 kg-corrugated boxes. Grape guards, pouches are kept inside the boxes for distant markets. Pre-cooling and use of grape guards are the musts for cold storage and export marketd.</br>",
